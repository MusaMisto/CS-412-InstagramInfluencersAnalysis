    "# This notebook serves as the main workspace for the CS412 course project on Instagram influencer analysis.\n",
    "# The project aims to develop machine learning models for two primary tasks:\n",
    "# 1. Multi-class classification to predict influencer categories based on profile meta-data and recent posts.\n",
    "# 2. Regression analysis to estimate content popularity (e.g., like_count) using relevant features.\n",
    "# The goal is to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build and evaluate models, and document findings."
